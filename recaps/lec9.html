      <h2 id="recap9_1">More Neural Network Examples</h2>

      Neural networks are useful for research in so many fields.
      <ul>
        <li> 
        Convolutional neural nets were applied to images representing the distribution of galaxies' velocities. This helped scientists understand the mass and clustering patterns of galaxies.
        </li>
        <li>
        Neural networks can be used to predict which molecules will be most effective for creating blue LED lights, which makes the process of finding a suitable molecule much more efficient. Similarly, in a healthcare setting, neural networks can be used to predict what molecules might be useful drugs. 
        </li>
        <li>
        We can train neural networks on physics simulations to try and predict what simulations would output without actually having to run them. Also, we can study what these physics-trained neural networks are learning. Are they actually somehow learning laws of physics? Could we study what they've learned to uncover new laws of physics?
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="recap9_2">Optimizing the Neural Network</h2>
      Last time, we talked about neural network architectures. Today, we'll discuss how neural networks can be optimized. (Spoiler: it's a lot of chain rule.) We'll use $\sigma$ as our activation function in lecture, but you can replace it with other activation functions like tanh or ReLU as well.<br><br>

      To optimize a neural network, we'd like to choose parameters $W$ that minimize the network's loss. We can find these parameters via gradient descent, but first we'll have to calculate the gradients of the network's loss with respect to the parameters. <br><br>

      So, we are trying to find:

      $$\frac{\partial L}{\partial W}$$

      For some input $x_n$, the loss function $L$ is some way to measure the difference between the true value $y_n$ and the value $f_n$ our model predicts for $x_n$. Previously when discussing regression, we used $\hat{y}_n$ to represent the model prediction instead of $f_n$. Since the loss function must depend on $f_n$ (which in turn depends on the model parameters we're trying to optimize), we'll need to use chain rule:

      $$\frac{\partial L}{\partial W} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial f_n} \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial W}$$

      <!-- Even though in real life, we probably will use packages to implement this and not implement backpropagation ourselves, it's good to understand the intuition behind this so we can better use the tools availble to us. By underestanding the details, we will know why are certain things slower, and why are certain things faster, etc.<br><br> -->

      <h4>Loss Function For Regression</h4>

      We've been using the least squares loss for regression.  

      $$L(w) = \frac12 \cdot \sum_n(y_n - f_n)^2$$

      The derivative with respect to $f_n$ will be:

      $$\frac{\partial L}{\partial f_n} = \sum_n (y_n - f_n)(-1)$$

      Note: If we swapped $L$ to be another loss function, the only effect on the whole original expression $\frac{\partial L}{\partial W}$ is a change in $\frac{\partial L}{\partial f_n}$. The rest of the gradient, $\frac{\partial f_n}{\partial W}$, remains the same.

      <h4>Loss Function For Classification</h4>

      For classification, a good loss function choice might be logistic loss. For a binary classification case, we define the following:<br><br>

      $$p(y=1|x) = \sigma(f_n) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-f_n)}$$
      $$p(y=0|x) = 1 - \sigma(f_n) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(f_n)}$$

      Now, we can define the logistic loss function using the terms above:<br><br>

      \begin{align*} 
      L(w) &= \sum_n y_n \log p(y=1|x) + (1 - y_n) \log p(y=0|x)
      \\ &= \sum_n y_n \log \sigma(f_n) + (1 - y_n) \log (1 - \sigma(f_n))
      \end{align*}

      Also remember the following helpful tip for the derivative:<br><br>
      $$\frac{\partial\sigma(z)}{z} = \sigma(z)(1 - \sigma(z))$$

      So then the derivative is:<br><br>

      $$\frac{\partial L_n}{\partial f_n} = y_n \frac{1}{\sigma(f_n)} \sigma(f_n) (1 - \sigma(f_n)) + (1 - y_n) \frac{1}{1 - \sigma(f_n)} \sigma(f_n)(1 - \sigma(f_n))(-1)$$

      We can simplify:<br><br>

      $$\frac{\partial L_n}{\partial f_n} = y_n (1 - \sigma(f_n)) - (1 - y_n) \sigma(f_n)$$

      This would be something we can calculate if we knew what $f_n$ was. So to get the gradient, we'll first have to use the current weights $W$ to calculate $f_n$ (a "forward pass"), then use $f_n$ to find the gradient (a "backward pass") and make our update step along the gradient.<br><br>
      
      Preview for intuition: in the forward pass, we start with an input $x_n$ and move forward through the layers of the model to figure out what the output $f_n$ would be (along with what other activation values in the network are). In the backward pass, the values we've calculated flow backwards to be used in chain rule products. (When we're working with many layers, $f_n$ will rely on $w_0$ a parameter in the first layer with $w_0$ nested inside many other products and activation functions. So then $\frac{\partial f_n}{\partial w_0}$ will involve a lot of chain rules.) These chain rule products become the gradients we are looking for.  
      
      <h2 id="recap9_3">Detour: Vector Chain Rule</h2>

      We will take a slight detour now in order to gain the tools we need to do the back propagation. Say we had nested functions as follows:

      $$y = f(u) = f(g(h(x)))$$
      $$u = g(v) = g(h(x))$$
      $$v = h(x)$$

      <h4>All Scalars</h4>

      If we had all scalars, and we wanted to look for $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$, then we can simply apply chain rule:<br><br>

      $$\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial y}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial v} \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$$<br><br>

      <h4>If x (size $D$) was a  vector </h4>

      $$\nabla_\mathbf{x}y = \frac{\partial y}{\partial u} \frac{\partial u}{\partial v} \nabla_\mathbf{x}v$$

      Where $\frac{\partial y}{\partial u}$ and $\frac{\partial u}{\partial v}$ are scalars, and
      $\nabla_\mathbf{x} v$ is a $1 \times D$ vector describing how each dimension of $\mathbf{x}$ affects scalar $v$.
      <br><br>

      Note: We are using the <em>numerator layout notation</em> (sometimes known as the <em>Jacobian formulation</em>),
      where if $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{x}$ are size $M$ and $N$ vectors respectively, then
      $\frac{\partial \mathbf{y}}{\partial \mathbf{x}}$ is an $M\times N$ matrix such that
      $$\frac{\partial \mathbf{y}}{\partial \mathbf{x}} =
      \begin{pmatrix}
      \frac{\partial y_1}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial y_1}{\partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial y_1}{\partial x_N} \\
      \frac{\partial y_2}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial y_2}{\partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial y_2}{\partial x_N} \\
      \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      \frac{\partial y_M}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial y_M}{\partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial y_M}{\partial x_N}
      \end{pmatrix}$$

      $\frac{\partial \mathbf{y}}{\partial \mathbf{x}}$ is known as the Jacobian matrix and represented as $\mathbb{J}_\mathbf{x}[\mathbf{y}]$. Its elements tell us how each element of $\mathbf{y}$ depends on each element of $\mathbf{x}$.  
      <br><br>

      <h4>If x (size $D$) and v (size $J$) were both vectors</h4>

      $$\nabla_\mathbf{x} y = \frac{\partial f}{\partial u} \nabla_\mathbf{v}u \mathbb{J}_\mathbf{x}[\mathbf{v}]$$

      $\frac{\partial y}{\partial u}$ is a scalar, $\nabla_\mathbf{v}u$ is a $1 \times J$ vector, and
      $\mathbb{J}_\mathbf{x}[\mathbf{v}]$ is a $J \times D$ matrix.
      <br>
      $\mathbb{J}_\mathbf{x}[\mathbf{v}]$ measures how each
      dimension of $\mathbf{x}$ affects each dimension of $\mathbf{v}$ and $\nabla_\mathbf{v}u$ how each
      dimension of $\mathbf{v}$ affects each dimension of $u$.
      <br>
      Chaining them,
      $\nabla_\mathbf{v}u \mathbb{J}_\mathbf{x}[\mathbf{v}]$ ($1 \times D$ vector) measures how each
      dimension of $\mathbf{x}$ affects each dimension of $u$.
      <br>
      Consequentially, $\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} \nabla_\mathbf{v}u \mathbb{J}_\mathbf{x}[\mathbf{v}]$ is a vector of
      how each $\mathbf{x}$ dimension changes scalar $y$, through all dimensions of $\mathbf{v}$ and $u$.
      <br><br>

      <h4>If x (size $D$) and v (size $J$) and u (size $J^\prime$) were all vectors</h4>

      $$\nabla_\mathbf{x} y = \nabla_\mathbf{u} y \mathbb{J}_\mathbf{v}[\mathbf{u}] \mathbb{J}_\mathbf{x}[\mathbf{v}]$$

      $\nabla_\mathbf{u} y$ is a $1 \times J^\prime$ vector, $\mathbb{J}_\mathbf{v}[\mathbf{u}]$ is a $J^\prime \times J$ matrix,
      $\mathbb{J}_\mathbf{x}[\mathbf{v}]$ is a $J\times D$ matrix.
      We still get a vector of how each $\mathbf{x}$ dimension changes scalar $y$, through all dimensions of $\mathbf{v}$
      and $\mathbf{u}$.
      <br><br>

      <h2 id="recap9_4">Let's Now Finish The Optimization</h2>

      As a refresher, we've had from before:

      $$\frac{\partial L_n}{\partial \mathbf{w}} = \frac{\partial L_n}{\partial f_n} \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial \mathbf{w}}$$

      We already calculated $\frac{\partial L_n}{\partial f_n}$ before, so we need to now calculate  $\frac{\partial f_n}{\partial \mathbf{w}}$.

      Let's say our $f_n = \mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{\phi_n} + b$. If so, that means we have:

      $$\frac{\partial f_n}{\partial \mathbf{w}} = \mathbf{\phi_n}$$

      <h4>Example: Let's Complete the Full Expression for the Regression Case</h4>

      From before for the regression case, we have $\frac{\partial L_n}{\partial f_n} = (y_n - f_n)(-1)$, and
      now we have $\frac{\partial f_n}{\partial \mathbf{w}} = \mathbf{\phi_n}$, so combined we have:<br><br>

      $$\frac{\partial L_n}{\partial \mathbf{w}} = (y_n - f_n)(-1) \mathbf{\phi_n}$$

      <br><br>
      Notice that we still need the value $f_n$ to compute the gradient.
      <br>

      <em>How will we get this term?</em> We can first compute $\mathbf{x} \rightarrow \mathbf{\phi_n} \rightarrow \mathbf{f_n}$ and then use
      that value of $\mathbf{f_n}$ in the gradient.

      <br><br>
      Recall that $\mathbf{\phi_n} = \sigma (\mathbf{W}^1\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}^1)$. <em>How can we get $\nabla_\mathbf{W}\mathcal{L}_n$</em>?

      <br><br>

      $$\nabla_\mathbf{W}\mathcal{L}_n = \frac{\partial L_n}{\partial f_n} \nabla_\mathbf{\phi_n}f_n \mathbb{J}_\mathbf{W^1}[\mathbf{\phi_n}]$$
<!--      Here we are required to take the gradient of a vector $\mathbf{\phi_n}$ with respect to a matrix $\mathbf{W}$.-->
<!--      There isn't a notation for vectors-by-matrices derivatives that is widely agreed upon. We will do this by first flattening-->
<!--      $\mathbf{W}$ from a $J \times D$ matrix into a $J*D$ vector when thinking about the derivative-->


      <h2 id="recap9_5">Let's Generalize Everything</h2>
      The process of computing gradients for optimizing neural networks, which was previewed earlier on, is then as follows:

      <ol>
        <li>
          Compute $\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{\phi}^{L}(\mathbf{\phi}^{L-1}(\cdots \mathbf{\phi}^{1}(\mathbf{x}))))$ by passing $\mathbf{x}$
          through the network $\mathbf{x} \rightarrow \mathbf{\phi}^{1} \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow
          \mathbf{\phi}^{L-1} \rightarrow \mathbf{\phi}^{L} \rightarrow \mathcal{L}$ (forward pass) and store all
          $\mathbf{\phi}^\ell$.
        </li>
        <li>
          Perform the chain-rule backwards:
          <ul>
            <li>
              $$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{\phi}^\ell} = \nabla_{\mathbf{\phi}^L}\mathcal{L}
              \mathbb{J}_{\mathbf{\phi}^{L-1}}[\mathbf{\phi}^{L}] \cdots \mathbb{J}_{\mathbf{\phi}^{\ell}}[\mathbf{\phi}^{\ell + 1}]$$
            </li>
            <li>
              Compute the parameter gradients
              $$\begin{align*}
                \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{W}^\ell} &= \nabla_{\mathbf{\phi}^L}\mathcal{L}
              \mathbb{J}_{\mathbf{\phi}^{L-1}}[\mathbf{\phi}^{L}] \cdots \mathbb{J}_{\mathbf{\phi}^{\ell}}[\mathbf{\phi}^{\ell + 1}]
              \mathbb{J}_{\mathbf{W}^{\ell}}[\mathbf{\phi}^{\ell}] \\
              &= \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{\phi}^\ell} \frac{\partial \mathbf{\phi}^\ell}{\partial \mathbf{W}^\ell}
              \end{align*}$$
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      The following picture illustrates the steps: <br><br>

      <div class="text-center">
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/recap9_1.png" style="width:60%"  alt="Reverse-mode AutoDiff Diagram"></img>
      </div>

      <br><br>
      <strong>Note: </strong> This is called "reverse-mode" autodiff or backpropagation. This is good when the output ($y$) is small and there
      are many parameters (all the $W$s). It allows for efficient reuse of computed values.

      <br><br>
      We can also do "forward-mode" diff. Suppose we wanted just a derivative/sensitivity test on
      $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_n}{\partial x_{nd}}$. Then we don't need all the $\frac{\partial \mathbb{\phi}}{\partial W_{jd^\prime}}$
      for all $d^\prime \neq d$.
      <br>
      Forward mode goes from the variable $x_{nd}$ to $\mathcal{L}_n$ rather than from $\mathcal{L}_n$ to $x_{nd}$.
      <br>
      We compute $\frac{\partial \mathbf{\phi}^1}{\partial x_{nd}}$, then $\frac{\partial \mathbf{\phi}^2}{\partial \mathbf{\phi}^1}$
      all the way up.

      <h2 id="recap9_6">Why does this all work?</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>GPUs allow us to do fast, parallelized matrix multiplications.</li>
        <li>We now have lots of data, and lots of data avoids overfitting. Neural networks are good at interpolating large datasets. </li>
        <li>Practicalities
          <ul>
            <li>Theory is lagging, but belief is that the over-parameterization enables easier gradient descent (gradient descent doesn't work in simpler models).</li>
