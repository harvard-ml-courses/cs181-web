# cs181-web

Course Website for CS 1810: Machine Learning at Harvard University in Spring 2025.

Based on design by Alvin Wan (alvinwan.com) for CS294-112 at UC Berkeley.

(Note to staff: See the staff repository for website update instructions.)

Built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) and deployed via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) at <https://harvard-ml-courses.github.io/cs181-web/>.

See the Jekyll docs linked above for local development instructions. If you're on a Mac, do *not* use the system installation of Ruby (`/usr/bin/ruby`). Instead, install it via Homebrew (`brew install ruby`) and make sure the path to the new installation is in your `PATH` environment variable.

Once Jekyll is installed, run

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```
